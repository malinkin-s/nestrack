# Nestrack architecture

**English** · [Русский](ARCHITECTURE.ru.md)

Nestrack grew out of [finnpower-counter](https://github.com/malinkin-s/finnpower-counter), a standalone utility
built for one job on one machine: show the operator of a Prima Power /
Finn-Power punching machine (NCeXpress FMS postprocessor) which positions of
a shift task are complete. Nestrack takes the same idea further — role-based
sign-in, a production log, saved sessions, a live view for the shift
supervisor, directory and ERP integration. All of that is built around a
**server**, with a **client** at the operator's workstation.

finnpower-counter stays a separate, standalone project. Nestrack reuses its
file parsing as a dependency.

This document records the decisions and the reasons behind them. The order
of work is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md), the task breakdown in
[TASKS.md](TASKS.md).

Status: **planned, not implemented.**

```

| Who | Uses | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Operator | Client on the shop-floor PC | Opens a shift task, marks programs, saves sessions |
| Supervisor | Server web page in a browser | Watches production live, exports CSV |
| Administrator | Server web page | Users, workstations, backups |

Test benches for all of this: [TEST_BENCH.md](TEST_BENCH.md).

Only the operator runs the client: they need the folder with `.nc` files on
the shop-floor PC, and a browser cannot read it. The supervisor and the
administrator install nothing.

### Target system

How the whole system is meant to work once all stages are done: abstract
nodes, the concrete technology on each, and the links between them.
Dashed links are optional or later stages.

If the server is unreachable, steps 4–11 wait in the client outbox; if the
ERP is unreachable, steps 12–13 wait in the integration outbox. Neither
stops the operator.

## Why a server rather than a shared network folder

The first draft of this plan kept the data on a shared network drive with
no server: a log of encrypted files, keys in a file, folder polling. It
would work, but nearly all of its complexity comes from having no central
node:

| Concern | Shared folder | Server |
|---|---|---|
| Concurrent writes from several PCs | A log of files — SQLite on a network drive gets corrupted | A real database with transactions |
| Seeing other clients' changes | Poll the folder every few seconds | The server pushes events immediately |
| Encryption | Hand-rolled on Windows CNG via ctypes — the main Win7 risk | TLS from the standard library |
| Brute-forcing a PIN from a copied key file | Mitigated by a workstation secret | Nothing to brute-force: the server checks the PIN and limits attempts |
| Role permissions | Enforced by the client only | Enforced by the server |
| Recording production under someone else's name | Not prevented | The server sets the author from the sign-in session |
| Clock drift between PCs | Event IDs; timestamps unreliable | The server sets the time |

The cost: a machine for the server and someone to look after it, two
programs instead of one, and a contract between them (the API). For a shop
with several workstations and a supervisor who wants live data it is worth
it.

The shared folder stays as a **fallback** if a server turns out to be
impossible: the client's storage layer sits behind an interface, and the
second option can be plugged in without touching the window or the core.

---

## What stays the same

- **Client: Windows 7 32-bit, Python 3.8.10, a single `.exe`, no external
  dependencies.** HTTPS and JSON are in the standard library (`http.client`,
  `ssl`, `json`).
- **Program files are read-only.** The client never writes to `.nc`, `.fms`
  or setup sheets and never talks to the machine control.
- **File parsing comes from finnpower-counter.** Its `core/` (and the
  stdlib-only `presentation` helpers) is installed as a pinned, tagged
  package and bundled into the client `.exe` by PyInstaller. Parser
  improvements are made there and reach both projects.
- **Standalone use stays with finnpower-counter.** A shop that needs no
  server keeps using it; the Nestrack client always works with a server and
  survives outages with its offline mode.

## What is different from finnpower-counter

- **The client needs the network.** finnpower-counter's build excludes `ssl`,
  `http`, `socket`, `email` and `urllib` on purpose; the Nestrack client
  includes them.
- **History is kept** — on the server, not on the shop-floor PC.
  finnpower-counter keeps none.
- Program files are still never modified and the machine is not touched.

---

## Server

### Platform

The server is not bound by the shop-floor constraints: modern Python,
ordinary dependencies.

- **Primary platform: Linux in Docker.** One command brings the server up
  on a test VM and on the shop floor. The reference deployment is
  `docker compose`.
- **Windows is supported too.** The code uses nothing Linux-only, and CI
  runs the server tests on Windows as well. Running as a Windows service is
  documented when it is needed.

### Technology

| What | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Web framework | FastAPI + Uvicorn | Async, generates the API description |
| Database | SQLite in WAL mode on the server's local disk | Tens of events per shift; plenty of headroom, backup is a file copy |
| Data access | SQLAlchemy Core + Alembic | Schema migrations; moving to PostgreSQL is a connection-string change |
| Password and PIN hashes | `hashlib.scrypt` | Standard library, slow by design |
| Web pages | Jinja2 templates + a little JavaScript | No heavy front end: tables, filters, CSV |
| Live updates | Server-Sent Events | Plain HTTP: `EventSource` in the browser, `http.client` in the client |

**Why SSE, not WebSocket.** The stream goes one way — from the server to the
clients; the client sends marks as ordinary requests. SSE is an ordinary HTTP
response that never ends: both a browser and a Python 3.8 client can read it
without third-party libraries. WebSocket is not in the standard library.

**Caching.** A separate server-side cache (Redis and the like) is not needed:
the volumes are small and the database answers faster than the network to
the shop floor. Caching belongs on the client, for working offline (below).

### Data

| Table | Holds |
|---|---|
| `users` | Name, role, PIN or password hash, blocked flag |
| `workstations` | Registered shop-floor PCs and their keys |
| `auth_sessions` | Sign-in sessions: who, from which workstation, until when |
| `tasks` | Shift tasks: content-based ID, program names |
| `events` | Production log: marks and unmarks |
| `bookmarks` | Users' saved sessions |
| `settings` | Administrator settings: shifts, time format, retention, visibility |
| `audit` | Sign-ins, failed attempts, administrator actions |
| `connections`, `mappings`, `integration_outbox`, `api_tokens` | Integration hub (stage 8) |

Where the database and backups live is set by the administrator in the
server configuration (a Docker volume or a folder on the server's disk).

### Encryption

- **In transit — TLS.** The server speaks HTTPS only.
- **At rest — by the OS**: disk or volume encryption on the server (LUKS,
  BitLocker). Encrypting individual database fields buys little: the server
  has to decrypt them anyway, and key management gets harder.
- **Certificate.** Shop networks rarely have their own certificate
  authority, so the server generates a self-signed certificate and the
  client pins its fingerprint when the workstation is registered, trusting
  nothing else afterwards. The server cannot be impersonated on the network.

---

## Sign-in and workstations

- **Workstation registration.** The administrator creates a workstation in
  the web panel and gets a one-time code. The code is entered in the client
  once; the client receives a workstation key and the certificate
  fingerprint and stores them protected by Windows (DPAPI).
- **Operator sign-in: name from a list plus PIN.** The server accepts a PIN
  only from a registered workstation and locks sign-in after several wrong
  attempts. A stolen PIN is useless without a shop-floor PC.
- **Supervisor and administrator sign-in**: user name and password in the
  browser.
- **Roles are enforced by the server.** The client only hides what is not
  available; permission comes from the server.

### Offline sign-in

If the server is unreachable at start-up, an operator can sign in if they
have signed in on this PC before: the client keeps a PIN verifier from the
last successful sign-in, protected by DPAPI. Marks made this way are flagged
"offline sign-in" and accepted by the server once the connection is back,
on the strength of the workstation key.

---

## Production

### Event

Marking a program as done is an event:

| Field | Set by | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | client | UUID — safe resending without duplicates |
| `type` | client | `program_done` / `program_undone` |
| `task` | client | task ID (below) |
| `position`, `program` | client | 7, `PRG_07` |
| `sheets`, `pieces` | client | 5, `{"555001_zz2": 20}` |
| `occurred_at` | client | when the button was pressed, by the PC clock |
| `operator`, `workstation` | **server** | from the sign-in session |
| `received_at` | **server** | by the server clock |

The server sets the author and the receive time: a client cannot record
production under someone else's name. Resending an event with the same `id`
changes nothing.

Unmarking is a `program_undone` event, not a deletion. For each program of a
task the last event in the server's receive order wins.

### Task ID

The same task is opened from different PCs via different paths. So the ID is
a hash of the program set — `.nc` names and contents. The client does the
parsing with the same `core/`; the server receives ready sheet and piece
counts.

### Totals and recovery

- Totals are computed from events: per operator, day, shift, task; sheets,
  programs, positions, pieces. A correction is a new event, not an edit.
- The next shift opens the same task and sees the previous shift's marks —
  from any workstation. That closes the original shift-handover problem.
- The supervisor sees each mark immediately: the server broadcasts the event
  to every subscribed client and page.

---

## Sessions

The log is the single source of truth about marks. A session is a **named
bookmark** on the server:

- the user types a name; the save date and time are added to it;
- the session stores its author, the task (ID and path) and the marks at the
  moment of saving;
- opening a session opens its task with the current marks; the marks at
  save time are shown for comparison.

---

## Client

### Asynchrony

Tk may only be touched from the main thread, and the network may take
seconds to answer.

- **All server traffic runs on a background thread** (`nestrack_client/worker.py`).
  The window queues a job and gets the result through `root.after()`. The
  window never freezes.
- **The event stream** has its own background thread: it reads SSE and hands
  changes to the window. On a drop it reconnects with a back-off.
- **Connection state is visible** in the window: "connected",
  "offline, N marks waiting to be sent".

### Working offline

- Marks go to a **local outbox** and are sent when the connection returns.
  Resending is safe thanks to the event `id`.
- A **local cache** holds the last known task state and the operator list for
  sign-in. The outbox and the cache are encrypted with DPAPI: copied off the
  shop-floor PC, they cannot be read elsewhere.
- If two operators mark the same thing while offline, the server's receive
  order wins and the supervisor sees such marks flagged.

---

## Integrations

Two kinds, both on the server and both configured by the administrator:

- **Directory (stage 7).** An authentication provider interface with `local`
  and `ldap` implementations: supervisors and administrators sign in with
  Active Directory accounts, roles follow domain groups. Operators keep
  name + PIN at the machine.
- **Integration hub (stage 8).** ERP and other systems are connected through
  connector plugins configured in the admin panel: connection profiles,
  encrypted secrets, routing of event types, mapping tables, an integration
  outbox with retries and a delivery log, and an Integration API for systems
  that prefer to read from us (typical for 1C).

Details and research: [INTEGRATIONS.md](INTEGRATIONS.md).

---

## Client–server contract

- **The API is versioned**: `/api/v1/...`. Shop-floor clients are not updated
  all at once, so the server keeps the previous API version while it is in
  use.
- On connect the client reports its version and the server its minimum
  supported one. A client that is too old gets a clear "please update"
  message, not an obscure error.
- The server generates the API description (OpenAPI), and it is kept in the
  repository so that changes show up in pull requests.

File parsing is not in this repository: the client depends on a tagged
release of finnpower-counter.

Client and server live in one repository: the contract between them changes
in a single pull request, and the tests check both sides at once.

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Python 3.8 on Windows 7 cannot negotiate TLS with the server | Check on a real machine first, stage 0 |
| DPAPI via ctypes misbehaves on Win7 | Same check, stage 0 |
| The server is unreachable | Offline work and outbox; shops that need no server use finnpower-counter |
| finnpower-counter and Nestrack drift apart | Nestrack pins a tagged finnpower-counter release; parser changes go through finnpower-counter's tests first |
| Losing the server database | Scheduled backups, restore drills |
| Mixed client versions on the floor | API versioning, minimum client version |
| Nobody to look after the server | One-command Docker deployment, instructions for IT |
